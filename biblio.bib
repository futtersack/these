  abstract={The use of magnetic fields is quite common in low-pressure, low-temperature, gas-discharge devices for industrial applications. However, transport in such devices is still not very well clarified, mainly due to the presence of walls playing a crucial role and to the variety of configurations studied. The latter often obstruct the underlying basic physical phenomena and make the different studies valid only for very specific configurations. This work presents a numerical study of particle transport in low-pressure (0.3 Pa) plasmas across a localized transverse magnetic field (magnetic barrier) by means of the 2D3V particle-in-cell with Monte Carlo collisions method. The problem is treated as generally as possible while trying to reveal the basic physics, using very simplified chemistry and considering a simple rectangular configuration. The conditions chosen for the magnetic field are common to many applications—magnetized electrons and almost unmagnetized ions. Two basic configurations with different magnetic field directions are analyzed in detail: magnetic field perpendicular to the simulation plane and along the simulation plane. An extensive parametric study is carried out in order to obtain the main trends and scaling laws for particle transport with respect to different parameters: plasma density, magnetic barrier size and magnetic field magnitude. The total current of electrons crossing the barrier is found to scale linearly with the plasma density, which extends the validity of the obtained results to a wide range of plasma density values.}

  abstract={Negative ion based neutral beam injection (N-NBI) systems which produce powerful high energy hydrogen atom beams are currently used on fusion reactor devices for plasma heating and current drive. To produce sufficient negative ions (NIs), sources with a large surface area are needed for reactor relevant injectors. Plasma source non-uniformity is a recurring issue in the present N-NBI systems, it is mainly due to the transverse magnetic field (filter field) at the front of the source which generates plasma gradients. This paper presents experimental results on a large size arc driven ion source at CEA, called Cybele, the purpose of the experiment is to compare the plasma density distribution (uniformity) between two magnetic confinements, (1) the transverse (horizontal) magnetic filter which is implemented in the present negative ion (NI) sources and (2) a new concept based on the magnetic mirror principle. Experiments show that in Cybele the standard configuration with the horizontal filter field (1) leads to a significant vertical plasma drift with a measured plasma density seven times higher at the top of the source, while the source with the vertical field and mirror-like confinement (2) is vertically uniform within ±10% and can operate at very low filling pressure (0.1 Pa).}

  abstract={In the limit of a small Debye length ( lambda D to 0) the analysis of the plasma boundary layer leads to a two-scale problem of a collision free sheath and of a quasi-neutral presheath. Bohm's criterion expresses a necessary condition for the formation of a stationary sheath in front of a negative absorbing wall. The basic features of the plasma-sheath transition and their relation to the Bohm criterion are discussed and illustrated from a simple cold-ion fluid model. A rigorous kinetic analysis of the vicinity of the sheath edge allows one to generalize Bohm's criterion accounting not only for arbitrary ion and electron distributions, but also for general boundary conditions at the wall. It is shown that the generalized sheath condition is (apart from special exceptions) marginally fulfilled and related to a sheath edge field singularity. Due to this singularity, smooth matching of the presheath and sheath solutions requires an additional transition layer. Previous investigations concerning particular problems of the plasma-sheath transition are reviewed in the light of the general relations.}
